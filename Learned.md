## What I learned

I learned a multitude of concepts during this term. I learned about scope and the flow of data, MVC, Express and React and also a lot about myself and how I work

---

## Scope and data flow/Call Stack

In the beginning of the term we focused a lot on understadning the concept of scopes and the call stack.
I learned that everything has a flow and a order.

It was important to know these concepts because when I write my functions and have data being moved around i can predict when and how my data will change based on the order of the callstack.

## MVC

module view controller is a concept that basically structures the app in a way that makes sense.

Essentially you get to decide what functionality and data is being provided to the user. For example, you want a user to be able to see their data but not the data of every other user on the app, or even all the functionality that goes into it . With MVC you cna control that and structure the app that way.

## Express

This was a big one. Express is in my view, a swiss army knife when making an app.
It has a bunch of tools that one can use in order to make the app.

With express I can create sessions, validate inputs with a lot less code and all sorts of other functionality.

---
### EJS

EJS is a view that allows me to put code into a html and also pull values to display.
With EJS i learned how to only display a webpage if the user has been authorized or not.

---
### Passport
Passport is a tool that allows me to create models or 'blueprints' on how i want certain forms of data structured and should be accepted when created. 

It also allows me to authenticate users.

 ---

 ### Mongodb
 I learned about mongoDB and robo3t as databases to store data to then later use in an app.

---
### React
React essentially allows me to control elements on the page and only those elements. In other words only the components on the page are affected by the user and not the entire page unless they relate to the component being changed therefore the whole page does not need to reload.

I also learned how to use react as my frontend while express being my backend.

---
### What I learned about my workflow

THe biggest takeaway i learned about my workflow is that i need more manual practice. I can understand concepts pretty quickly but when it comes to actually doing it, I need to actually put the concepts into practice. I can read all the articles in the world and watch all the videos that ever exisited but that doesnt always correlate to skill.

Another big thing i learned is that i need to be more creative when choosing what kind of app to make and be more creative with features. Part of this comes from complacency. I tend to just worry about what are the standards and not about how can i exceed the standards. This is results in a project that yea ticks all the boxes but makes me question am i really proud of the work i did.

My last biggest flaw is that I struggle to ask for help when I need it. I tend to focus soo much time trying to solve a problem myself that by the time I solve it, there isnt too much time for something else

On the positive side of things, I see my growth. In term 1 it took me forever to get started on a project because I just simply was not as good a coder as I am now . Today I can pretty much get started right away.  I can also pretty much get any data i want from a 3rd party api and relatively quickly at that. Overall i work pretty fast.
